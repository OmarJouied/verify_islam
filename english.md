    Prove to me that the Book that was revealed 1400 years ago is from Allah
  
    
    How come you bring me evidence from the Book itself?
  
    
    How come you bring me evidence from the Book itself?
  
    
    Well, I'll bring in this episode 11 evidence that the Qur’an is a book from Allah
  
    
    From outside the Qur’an
  
    
    And that Muhammad (PBUH) is a messenger from Allah
  
    
    From outside the Qur'an and Islam
  
    
    How's that?!
  
    
    
    First Evidence: The saying of Allah (The Exalted)
   "Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke" [Fussilat:11]
  
    
    Smoke confirms that the origin of this universe is a flaming thing
  
    
    Not a lake of water as was believed in all philosophies, thoughts, and religions at the time of the Prophetic Mission
  
    
    Everyone was imagining that the origin of the universe is water
  
    
    But the Qur'an came in that environment and confirmed that the origin of the sky's orbits is smoke, not water
  
    
    This is an axiom in modern science
  
    
    The orbits of the sky, without controversy among scientists today, are condensed smoke
  
    
    
    Secondly: The saying of Allah (The Exalted)
   "And the heaven We constructed with strength" [Al-Dhariyat:47]
  
    
    The sky is a construction, and not blank as the viewer might imagine
  
    
    Surprisingly, the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics demonstrated the course of gravitational waves on the fabric of space-time
  
    
    Space-time is the intertwining of space and time
  
    
    They form a fabric together
  
    
    Gravitational waves move on this fabric
  
    
    The sky is literally constructed
  
    
    Thirdly: "And indeed, We are its expander"
  
    
    
    "And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are its expander"
  [Al-Dhariyat:47]
  
    
    The sky expands over time
  
    
    This fact was never imagined by anyone even in Einstein's time
  
    
    Rather, Einstein himself insisted that the sky is static and does not expand
  
    
    Then in 1929, it was discovered that the sky expands
  
    
    This is an axiom in modern science today
  
    
    After this discovery, Einstein admitted that his insistence that the sky is static and doesn't expand was the greatest scientific mistake he had made in his life
  
    
    1400 years before Einstein, the Qur’an said that the sky expands
  
    
    "And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are its expander"
  
    
    
    Fourthly: The saying of Allah (The Exalted)
   "And by the morning when it breathes" [Al-Takwir:18]
  
    
    The sun in the morning heats the surface of the earth
  
    
    Consequently, the air in contact with it heats up, moves upward, and replaced by air from the upper layers
  
    
    As if the earth in the morning is like a huge lung that expels the air in contact with it and this air is replaced by another air
  
    
    "And by the morning when it breathes"
  
    
    
    Fifthly: The saying of Allah (The Exalted)
  "And We have made the night and day two signs"
  
    
    
    "Then, We erased the sign of the night and made the sign of the day visible"
  [Al-Isra' :12]
  
    
    "Then, We erased the sign of the night and made the sign of the day visible"
  
    
    The sign of the night is the moon, and the sign of the day is the sun
  
    
    The sign of the night was erased while the sign of the day remained visible
  
    
    Was the moon a fiery mass like the sun and then it was erased?
  
    
    This is now one of the greatest scientific issues discovered about the moon
  
    
    The moon was indeed a fiery mass
  
    
    NASA has released on its official website a video clip entitled "Evolution of the Moon", in which it addresses this scientific issue
  
    
    The moon was indeed a fiery mass and then its light was erased over time
  
    
    Sixthly: Muhammad (PBUH) is the one whom Allah told Moses about
  
    
    
    He said: "I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers"
  [Deuteronomy 18:18]
  
    
    A prophet like you -Moses- will come from among the brothers of the Children of Israel
  
    
    The brothers of the Children of Israel are the Arabs, the sons of Ismael
  
    
    From among the brothers of the Children of Israel
  
    
    From among the sons of Ismael
  
    
    A prophet like you -Moses- will come
  
    
    No prophet came from the sons of Ismael except Muhammad (PBUH)
  
    
    If this prophecy wasn't about Muhammad (PBUH), then it has not occurred until now!
  
    
    Muhammad (PBUH) was like Moses
  
    
    Both of them were strivers in the way of Allah
  
    
    Both of them called people to monotheism
  
    
    Both of them were harmed for the cause of Allah
  
    
    
    "We have sent to you a Messenger as a witness upon you
   just as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger" [Al-Muzzammil:15]
  
    
    Muhammad (PBUH) was like Moses (PBUH)
  
    
    
    "I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers"
  [Deuteronomy 18:18]
  
    
    Whoever does not follow this Prophet, he will be held accountable
  
    
    
    "And whoever will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name,
  I will require it of him" [Deuteronomy 18:19]
  
    
    
    Thus, according to the text of the Torah, every person is obligated to follow
   the Prophet who will come from the sons of Ismael (PBUH)
  
    
    
    Seventhly: Allah (The Exalted and Majestic) told Prophet Isaiah about
  Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)
  
    
    He said to him: "Behold, my servant, whom I uphold"
  
    
    
    "My chosen, I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations"
  [Isaiah 42:1]
  
    
    And this prophet will raise the voice of Adhan [call to prayer]
  
    
    
    "Let the desert and its cities lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits"
  [Isaiah 42:11]
  
    
    The voice of Adhan will be raised in the homes of Kedar
  
    
    There is no doubt that Kedar is the son of Ismael (PBUH)
  
    
    Kedar is the grandfather of Adnan and the grandfather of Quraish
  
    
    The Adhan will be raised in the homes of Quraish by this forthcoming Prophet
  
    
    So who is he?!
  
    
    Only the praises of Islam were raised in Quraysh
  
    
    The voice of Adhan had not raised in it except by Muhammad (PBUH)
  
    
    "Let the desert and its cities lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits"
  
    
    "Let the habitants of Sela sing for joy"
  
    
    Where is Sela located?
  
    
    Sela is located in Medina, 500 meters away from the Prophetic Mosque
  
    
    There are many hadiths in which Sela was mentioned
  
    
    Authentic prophetic hadiths
  
    
    Sela is a well-known mountain in Medina until today
  
    
    The voice Adhan will be raised in Mecca and Medina by this forthcoming Prophet
  
    
    So who is he?!
  
    
    So who is he?!
  
    
    Eighthly: Prophet Jacob (PBUH) told his sons about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)
  
    
    This happened in his will before his death
  
    
    He said: "The scepter shall not depart from Judah"
  
    
    Ruling shall not depart from the Jews
  
    
    "Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet"
  
    
    That is, the law shall not depart from them
  
    
    "Until Shiloh comes"
  
    
    Judgment and legislation will remain for the children of Israel until Shiloh comes
  
    
    
    "And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples"
  [Genesis 49:10]
  
    
    "Until Shiloh comes"
  
    
    Shiloh means shackles remover
  
    
    Who would relieve them of their burden and the shackles which were upon them
  
    
    
    The shackles of the severe legislative provisions that had been imposed on
  the children of Israel for their wrongdoing
  
    
    
    Our Lord (Glory be to Him) said:
   "Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet"
  
    
    "Whom they find written with them in the Torah and the Gospel"
  
    
    What is the attribute of this Prophet?
  
    
    Let's continue with the verse
  
    
    
    "And relieves them of their burden and the shackles which were upon them"
   [Al-A'raf:157]
  
    
    So, the Qur'an tells us that the attribute of the Prophet (PBUH) exists in their Torah
  
    
    Shackles remover
  
    
    "The scepter shall not depart from Judah"
  
    
    "Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet"
  
    
    "Until Shiloh comes"
  
    
    
    "And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples"
  [Genesis 49:10]
  
    
    Peoples will obey him
  
    
    He will be a striver Prophet
  
    
    Kingdoms of the earth will be conquered by his nation
  
    
    His message spread in the East and West over the span of one generation
  
    
    
    Ninthly: Allah (Glory be to Him) told Prophet Haggai about the coming
   of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)
  
    
    Rather, He told him his name -Muhammad-
  
    
    
    He said to him:
  "I will shake all nations, and what is desired by all nations will come" [Haggai 2:7]
  
    
    The word "Mushtaha" in the Hebrew text means praiseworthy i.e Muhammad
  
    
    As we detailed in a previous episode
  
    
    We mentioned this point in detail from Hebrew sources in a previous episode
  
    
    The link of this episode is the second link in the video description
  
    
    "And what is desired by all nations will come"
  
    
    And the praiseworthy "Muhammad" of all nations will come
  
    
    All nations here in the Hebrew text means the illiterate
  
    
    So, the correct Hebrew reading of the text of Haggai is:
  
    
    "And Muhammad of the illiterates will come"
  
    
    "Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet"
  
    
    "Whom they find written with them in the Torah" [Al-A'raf:157]
  
    
    Tenthly: Prophet Daniel (PBUH) foretold the time of Prophet Muhammad's mission (PBUH)
  
    
    Daniel (PBUH) saw in his vision four successive kingdoms that would rule the earth
  
    
    
    Babylonian Kingdom, Persian Kingdom, Kindgdom of Alexander the Great,
  and the Roman Kingdom
  
    
    
    After these four kingdoms, the saints of the Most High would come,
  who would fight idolatry
  
    
    In order to know the time of the emergence of the saints of the Most High
  
    
    In order to know the time of the emergence of this nation
  
    
    
    In the fourth Roman kingdom, a person whose attributes and deeds
  match Constantine the Great will emerge
  
    
    And his corruption will remain on the earth for three and a half centuries
  
    
    After this period, the Son of Man will emerge, whose nation will rule the four kingdoms
  
    
    And who will bring back monotheism to Earth
  
    
    Four kingdoms
  
    
    In the fourth Roman kingdom, a person will emerge
  
    
    The attributes of this person match Constantine the Great
  
    
    
    Three and a half centuries after Constantine the Great, the Son of Man will appear,
  whose nation will conquer the kingdoms
  
    
    This text from the Book of Daniel, these kingdoms, and the time of Constantine’s rule
  
    
    
    All these details will be discussed in this episode
  within the course of "Muslim Mind Fortification"
  
    
    
    Whoever wants to watch this episode before we post it,
  it's in the third link in the video description
  
    
    Three and a half centuries after Constantine, the Islamic nation emerged
  
    
    And it reigned over Babylon, Persia, and the Levant - the three kingdoms
  
    
    
    Not only that, but Daniel foretold that this nation would reign over
   the land of Constantine
  
    
    It will reign over the fourth kingdom
  
    
    The kingdom of Constantine the Great- Constantinople
  
    
    
    "But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess
   the kingdom forever, forever and ever"  [Daniel 7:18]
  
    
    
    For a researcher who has gained knowledge of all these miracles and foretellings,
  can he expect a prophet other than Muhammad (PBUH)?!
  
    
    
    Can he really expect anything in this universe greater than submitting to Allah 
  (Glory be to Him) and following His Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)?!
  
    
    I swear by Allah this is the greatest right you are obligated to do, O human!
  
    
    
    Eleventh Evidence: The Sacred House [Ka'bah], which will be the Qiblah of this nation
  [Qiblah is the direction that Muslims face when they pray]
  
    
    Which will be enlightened by monotheism
  
    
    Prophet Isaiah foretold this by saying: "The glory of the Lord has risen upon you"
  
    
    "For behold, darkness shall cover the earth"
  
    
    Darkness of disbelief shall cover the earth
  
    
    
    "But the Lord will arise upon you"
   [Isaiah 60-1-2]
  
    
    "The abundance of the sea shall be turned to you"
  
    
    
    "And the wealth of the nations shall come to you"
    [Isaiah 60-5]
  
    
    "To which are brought the fruits of all things" [Al-Qasas:57]
  
    
    "All Kedar’s flocks will be gathered to you"
  
    
    "Kedar’s flocks"
  
    
    "The rams of Nebaioth will serve you"
  
    
    "And I will adorn my glorious temple" [Isaiah 60-7]
  
    
    "Kedar’s flocks"
  
    
    Kedar, as we mentioned, is the son of Ismael and the grandfather of Quraish
  
    
    
    Are Kedar's sheep -Quraish sheep- led and slaughtered except for
   the Sacred House in Mecca?
  
    
    "All Kedar’s flocks will be gathered to you"
  
    
    
    The sacrifices of Kedar are not offered to any house  
  except to the Sacred House in Makkah
  
    
    "All Kedar’s flocks will be gathered to you"
  
    
    "And the rams of Nebaioth will serve you"
  
    
    Nebaioth is also the son of Ismail; his eldest son
  
    
    Thus, the sheep of the Arabs are not offered to any house except to the Sacred House
  
    
    These were some evidence that I wanted to mention in this episode
  
    
    
    I advise you and the dear viewers to read the book "Muhammad in the Bible"
  by the former priest of Urmia, Abd Al-Ahad Dawud
  
    
    The link of this book is the first link in the video description
  
    
    I advise you all to follow the course "Muslim Mind Fortification"
  
    
    We will detail some miracles and foretellings in it -if Allah wills-
  
    
    The link of this course is the fourth link in the video description
  
    
    I swear by Allah that if you want the truth, a verse will suffice you
  
    
    
    And if you want to go astray, I swear by Allah that a million verses,
   proofs, and miracles will not suffice you
  
    
    
    "And if they see every sign, they will not believe in it"
   [Al-An'am:25]
  
    
    We ask Allah to make us among those who listen to speech and follow the best of it
  
    
    
    "Those who listen to speech and follow the best of it, are the ones Allah has guided"
  [Al-Zumar: 18]
  
    
    Thank you for good listening
  
    
    May Allah reward you well
  
    
    Peace be upon you
  
    
    "And most of them follow not except assumption"
  
    
    "Indeed, assumption avails not against the truth at all"
  
    
    "Indeed, Allah is Knowing of what they do"
  
    
    "And it was not possible for this Qur'an to be produced by other than Allah"
  
    
    "But it is a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of the Scripture"
  
    
    
    "And a detailed explanation of the Scripture, about which there is no doubt,
   from the Lord of the worlds"
  
    
    "Or do they say [about the Prophet]: He invented it?"
  
    
    
    "Say: Then bring forth a surah like it and call upon [for assistance] 
  whomever you can besides Allah, if you should be truthful"
  
    
    
    "Rather, they have denied that which they encompass not in knowledge 
  and whose interpretation has not yet come to them"
  
    
    "Thus did those before them deny. Then observe how was the end of the wrongdoers"
  
    
    "And of them are those who believe in it, and of them are those who do not believe"
  
    
    "And your Lord is most knowing of the corrupters"
  
    
    "And if they deny you, then say: For me are my deeds, and for you are your deeds"
  
    
    "You are disassociated from what I do, and I am disassociated from what you do"
  
    
    "And among them are those who listen to you"
  
    
    "But can you cause the deaf to hear, although they will not use reason?"
  
    
    "And among them are those who look at you"
  
    
    "But can you guide the blind although they will not attempt to see?"
  
    
    
    "Indeed, Allah does not wrong the people at all, but it is the people 
  who are wronging themselves"
  
    
    
    "And on the Day when He will gather them, it will be as if they had not remained
   in the world but an hour of the day, and they will know each other"
  
    
    "Those will have lost who denied the meeting with Allah and were not guided"
  
    
    
    "And whether We show you some of what We promise them or We take you in death, 
  to Us is their return; then Allah is a witness concerning what they are doing"
